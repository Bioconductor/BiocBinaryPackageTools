Description: The package allows users to query the Bioconductor binary package
	     repositories for build status, build reports, failures, download
	     statistics, and other important metrics. The Bioconductor binary
	     packages are specifically for the 'bioconductor_docker' images and
	     their successive inheriting images. The binaries are available free
	     of cost to users, and speed up package installation by many orders of
	     magnitude.
